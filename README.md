# ONNX puzzles
Collection of puzzles to implement using onnxruntime.

## Note
These examples were created in the context on an ongoing project that used ONNX to export the models, 
around 2020. 
Some of the ops that are available now in ONNX Runtime were not available then, which necessitated these
workarounds. 
Hopefully, these will still help someone who is stuck with a specific ONNX op and might help look for workarounds.
